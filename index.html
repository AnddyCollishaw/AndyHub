            So I know this webiste has an interesting appearence similiar to a
            certain webiste that I am sure we are all familiar with... That's
            because it is definetly pased of <em>that website</em>. There is a
            good reason for that. I have been on a misson to gather skills that
            interest me and that will help me in my career. I am in school for
            electrical engineering so I learn a lot about physical electircial
            systems which are all great and make me very hirable. I beleive that
            if I have these skills and then I also teach myself skills involving
            software then that could be a great compliment to the skills I am
            getting from my formal education. One of the most used skills in the
            tech and software industry today is web development with HTML and
            CSS. I had no idea were to even start with leanring this so I
            watched a 50 minute very baseline intro to the topic that pretty
            much just taught me how to setup the enviorment and use chrome dev
            tools. There are tons of full courses for free on Youtube that are
            all great, but I have the focus of a toddler on coke so they don't
            work great for me so instead. So instead what I decided to do is try
            and recreated a website and learn by imitation as many great artists
            had before. I decided that <em>the hub</em> would be my weboste of
            choice since I thought it would be funny... At first I tried
            recreating the website just by looking at it and trying to search up
            how I might be able to get a similair look. This worked for a bit
            and I got a good grasp on how the very basics of HTML and CSS work.
            However my issue was that I didn't even know what to search up so I
            was just using my very limited knowledge to try and build the site.
            Then I remebered that I had learned about chorme dev tools in the
            intro video and realized that I could see exactly how the website
            had been built. With this realization I restarted and essentially
            copied the original code. This was very benificial since it exposed
            me to things like grids that I had no idea existed before I looked
            into how this page was built. At first I didnt really know how the
            stuff I was copying was working. As I continued working at it and
            inmvestigating how stuff was working I started to understand the
            concepts invloved in creating the website. I also realized that
            there was a high percentage of the CSS that was unnecrssary for the
            webiste to work to the level that I wanted it to work. So I then
            tore down the code which allowed me to see what everything is doing
            by deleting it and seeing what happens. This also simplified the
            code a lot and I was happy with the results. I considered just
            leaving it there but I decided to instead start over using what I
            had learned to create somthing completly mine from the ground up.
            This was the most fun part for me because I felt confident while I
            was going through and designing the website in my own way, resulting
            in what you see know. I was really happy with this litlle project
            and I feel like I now have a great base knowledge and know were I
            need to go next. Thats the thing that I have learned while teaching
            myself these different skills. The hardest part is knowing what you
            dont know and what you need to know. I now know that I want to learn
            how to implement javascript functions, host the webiste on the web,
            and create a full feldged site with multiple pages. I doubt anyone
            will actually every read this but hey you never know :P.
